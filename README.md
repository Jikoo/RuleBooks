# RuleBooks
Inspired by mstiles' BookRules, RuleBooks is a modern item-based rules plugin.

# Features
* Define and modify items marked as rules
   * Replace existing rules easily
   * Live edit written books, overwrite content on book and quill sign.
   * Items other than written books are supported, but it is recommended that you use a kit plugin if that is your intent. RuleBooks does not contain any safeguards against duplication of or crafting using rules other than villager trade prevention.
* Distribute rules on login
   * Entire feature can be disabled in configuration.
   * Users are given rules after a configurable delay.
   * Rules can be marked exempt from being distributed on login to prevent information overload.
* Dynamic rule updates
   * Rules are updated when interacted with. No more worries about outdated copies hanging around.
* Permissions for rules
   * Distribute your moderation guide or secret cult mantra only to the worthy.
